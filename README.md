This is a simple pixel art versio of an Etch-a-Sketch. I made this using a combination of HTML, CSS, and Java Script. The project is 
pretty basic but it lets you draw, clear the board, and turn the squares to random colors.This project took some weird turns where some
times things went really easy and other times I culdn't think of simple solutions like deleating the squares instead of the canvas itself. 
It used a lot of DOM manipulation which is a skill I learned recently. The script could likely be better but I am very happy with how the 
CSS came out. It was a fun little project that I am happy to have worked on and finished!
